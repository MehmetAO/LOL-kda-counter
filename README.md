# LOL-kda-counter

### The idea  
I created this program for a friend who streams on Twitch. The idea behind this project is creating entertainment for audience.
  
### What it does  
Everytime you die in League of Legends game, a funny led sign with "Loser" written on it lights up until you get a kill to clean your name. When you get a kill it turns the led sign off.
  
### How it works

This program watches the far upper right of the screen and turns that info to data with OCR. That data used for calculating deaths and kills. If you get killed. It talks to Arduino and it opens relay of led sign. When you get a kill vice versa.
  
### What Stage am I at  
It is completed.
